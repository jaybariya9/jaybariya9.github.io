Hi! 

I recently graduated with a Master's in Financial Engineering and Quantitative Finance from Stevens Institute of Technology, New Jersey. I am deeply passionate about financial markets - stocks, options, futures, fixed income, FX and commodities. 

My experiences spans across diverse areas of finance, specifically as a quantitative researcher, index trader and equity research. I am keen about market microstructure trading, volatility-liquidity trading and macro-momentum trading. I experiment in developing quantitative trading models from scratch with Python and R, conducting quantiative and qualitative research, backtesting strategies and assessing real-time performance. 

I love football. I analyze tactics and playstyle of top teams and managers from European soccer. I compare different attributes of players to assess strengths and weakness in their playstyle. Other interests include - gaming, photography, traveling and adventure sports.
